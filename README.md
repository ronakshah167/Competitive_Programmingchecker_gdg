## 🧠 Problem Statement

Many coding platforms focus only on whether code passes or fails, offering limited explanation. This creates a gap between coding practice and actual learning, especially for beginners who need clear guidance to improve.

## 💡 Our Solution

All In bridges this gap by using **Google Gemini AI** to analyze code and provide structured, easy-to-understand feedback. Instead of just results, users receive insights on logic, improvements, and best practices—making learning more effective and engaging.
